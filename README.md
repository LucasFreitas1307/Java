Java Projects made for help me to learn how to construct a back-end API using java

Basic commands in java

| Commands | Function |
| -------- | -------- | 
| Scanner  | A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions|
|System.out.print| Print for the user a information|
|scanner.nextLine| works like a scanf in C|
|if/else/else if| the same thing like as in C|
|Parameter passing| the same thing like as in C example:scanner = new Scanner(System.in);|
|Boolean| I didnt understand that shit yet|
